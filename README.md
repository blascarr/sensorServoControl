# sensorServoControl

	sensorServoControl is a library for control with analog sensors.

	The main objective is improve the performance and mechanical response 
	depending on values associated with analog inputs.

	Save up working operation energy performance.
	Compute time event intervals to read input signal
	Compute buffer based on mean values.
	Mapping in different range values.
	
  	
  	Blascarr invests time and resources providing this open source code like some other libraries, please
  	respect the job and support open-source software.
